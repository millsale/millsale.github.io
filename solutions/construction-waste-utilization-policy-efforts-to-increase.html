          <h1>Construction waste utilization policy efforts to increase</h1>
          <p>It is understood that, in order to encourage comprehensive utilization of construction waste, Shandong province to increase funding and policy support, the comprehensive use of fiscal, taxation, investment and other economic levers to encourage enterprises, direct investment and other ways to promote the construction waste comprehensive utilization project. Along with the city to speed up the process and the advance of the construction of small towns, construction waste has become all the headaches that. According to statistics, every 10000 square meters building construction process of construction waste, can produce 500 tons to 600 tons, the demolition of 10000 square meters of old buildings, will produce 7000 tons to 12000 tons of construction waste. According to incomplete statistics, the annual urban and rural construction in the demolition of old buildings, will produce up to 2 tons of construction waste. The number of construction waste in our country have been accounted for city garbage 30%-40%. In the face of such a huge construction waste, the traditional approach is mostly by the sanitation department to collect unified open dumps or proposed landfill. Random dumping of construction waste landfill not only takes up a lot of land, pollute the environment of the city, and with the construction waste pollution factors in the evaporation and infiltration, also caused different effects on surface water and deep water. Although in some parts of the implementation of two times with good phenomenon of construction waste, such as filling of subgrade and foundation of the use of construction waste and so on, but it is in its original state, compared with the traditional processing way and there is no essential progress.</p>
          <p>The implementation of "turning waste into treasure" of the two times to use as a kind of new energy technology and the transformation of the means has emerged of the construction waste. For example, on the basis of scientific classification, the use of science and technology method of construction waste crushing grinding processing, and then as a raw material for two times the processing and become a new building materials, implementation of the construction waste recycling, treatment so that not only solves the problem of construction waste, but also reflects the scientific development concept of environmental conservation. But in the actual operation, even if the two comprehensive utilization of construction waste has been quite mature technology, has been basically realized the construction waste "turning waste into treasure", but praised in reality. For example, awareness of the problem, to two times the use of construction waste and environmental protection building materials to create doubts and difficult to use in large area; for example, in some places because of the impact of economic factors, environmental protection building material model is unable to compete with the traditional solid clay brick; for example some places due to the lack of necessary control measures, construction the site and the construction unit but also a large number of illegal use of environmentally friendly building materials, and some new technology of construction waste, the implementation of processing and manufacturing of new building materials production enterprises is still hungry, because of lack of financial support and at a loss and other problems, and so on. The existence of these phenomena, the ideal effect of construction waste "turning waste into treasure" is not up to the expected. If you want to really solve the problem of construction waste pollution of the environment, it is difficult to deal with the problem, environmental protection and construction waste treatment to get promotion and popularization, must be multi force, speed up the construction waste reuse process, and achieved solid results.</p>
          <p>First of all, there must be the development of policy science. The functions of the government departments must attach great importance to the issue of construction waste in the process of urbanization, the policy of scientific treatment of construction waste for support, for example, make the construction unit must pay policy, scientific disposal of construction waste disposal fees; the restriction of the use of clay brick, to promote the production of new environmental protection building materials construction waste comprehensive utilization, the implementation of the new green building materials.Second, financial support. On the scientific disposal of construction waste and construction waste environment-friendly production enterprises, not only in terms of tax deductions and exemptions, but also to the implementation of financial subsidies and policy support. To punish non scientific disposal of construction waste behavior, outstanding award of scientific construction waste disposal behavior and enterprise. Third, reform of the classification of the disposal of construction waste. To promote advanced utilization, reduction of construction waste into cement, asphalt; promote the intermediate use, construction waste after processing into aggregates, and then made into a variety of building brick, the basic material used as a building or road; limit lower utilization, reduce on-site sorting and classification by using the general prohibition of arbitrary disposal of backfill, and not processed surface random stacking, landfill. In 2008, Weifang launched the use of construction waste production of building materials products industrialization projects, and take the lead in the province issued the "Implementation Opinions on further promoting the construction waste comprehensive utilization". As of the end of 2009, the scale of construction waste comprehensive utilization of more than Weifang enterprises reached 5, the annual use of 2600000 cubic meters of construction waste.</p>
          <p>"Now in the construction waste, the supply of new building materials market access, comprehensive utilization of resources and other aspects of the development of preferential policies, guide enterprises to accelerate the progress of construction projects, multi-channel utilization of construction waste." Deputy director of Weifang Municipal Economic and Information Technology Commission Wang Chengxi said, since last year, Weifang has no new construction waste landfill, the landfill will be gradually closed. The payment provisions of construction waste disposal to develop research, collect fees from the units produce construction waste, and to take appropriate forms of payment for construction waste comprehensive utilization enterprise. In view of this, to really solve the problem of construction waste pollution of the environment, it is difficult to dispose of the problem, highlighting the construction waste treatment and environmental protection are identified and the effect, it should be multi force, speed up the construction waste "turning waste into treasure" process. If we can create a development environment for building garbage disposal, well then, it can effectively change the dumping of construction waste landfill and open and deformity of construction waste disposal behavior, and the transformation of science two times using construction waste has become the mainstream, this is not only for the protection of the environment, but also to save the land, save resources, have a positive and far-reaching significance.</p>
