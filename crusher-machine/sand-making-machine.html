          <p>Energy saving and environmental protection is the biggest advantage of sand making machine equipment, the traditional natural aggregate resource in China is very short, the natural river sand is good building materials, although there is a huge amount of sand reservoir, but due to the corrosion of the metal salt, resulting in the decline in the quality of the buildings, therefore, is the largest source of mechanism sand instead of natural sand, mechanism sand can avoid a series of harm caused by the excessive mining of river sand, but also greatly enriched the market demand, therefore, the mechanism of sand is the quality of material is the most ideal to replace river sand. Sand making machine equipment according to the different uses can be divided into: River gravel sand making machine, limestone sand making machine, basalt stone sand making machine, granite sand making machine, marble sand making machine, calcite sand making machine, iron ore sand making machine, quartz sand making machine. According to the different working principle, sand making machine can be divided into the hammer crusher, impact crusher, counterattack crusher, compound type sand making machine, crusher, sand making machine is mainly suitable for plastic soft or hard and super hard materials, has been widely used in all kinds of ores, cement, refractories materials, aluminum where soil clinker, Jin Gang sand, glass raw materials, mechanism to build stone gold slag, especially for silicon carbide, Jin Gang sand, sintered bauxite, the sand high hard, and very hard abrasive resistant material than other types of crusher yield higher efficiencies.</p>

            <p>By the state policy of expanding domestic demand driven, over the road, railway and other infrastructure investment is increasing, effective development of large projects, in urgent need of a large number of high-quality aggregate supply. But in order to protect the ecological balance, the state expressly prohibited unauthorized excavation of natural sand, gravel supply can not keep up with demand, which requires a large amount of artificial sand. In the road along the way to establish the aggregate base, to ensure adequate supply in the construction, in the aggregate production, mainly rely on the sand and stone equipment production equipment, raw materials are mainly granite, limestone, pebbles and other hard stone, after feeding machine, jaw crusher, impact crusher, sand making machine, vibrating screen and a series of crushing and screening equipment into a hierarchy of needs. Artificial sand is decided by its own characteristics, the application of all aspects of the natural sand is higher than that of ordinary. Sand fineness is refers to the different particle size of sand mixed with average thickness. Usually have a coarse sand, fine sand, the. Grading of sand is sand size particles proportion. Sand porosity depends on the particle size of sand at all levels with the degree of. Well graded sand, not only can save cement, but also improve the density and strength of concrete and mortar. Usually have a coarse sand, fine sand, the. Artificial sand is composed of rock crushing and, due to the high cost, flaky and powdery materials, generally do not have. According to customer needs, with the crusher sand making machine or natural rock is crushed into the required fineness, especially the main equipment of sand making machine has been China gravel Association pushing for artificial mechanism sand. The development of artificial sand and gravel sand making machine not only solves the problem of sand used in construction of resources, and to improve the quality of sand and gravel, the rights and interests of the users, which has a positive effect. Because, the artificial sand are mechanized production, have a fixed production facilities and perfect management, quality of personnel is relatively high, and these are the most natural sand production enterprises lack. Building sand shall provide certificate of product in sand and concrete standard provides for a number of years, but so far not implemented. Through the development of artificial sand tailings have been overcome, and has a positive significance to improve the quality of the sand industry. Although the mechanism of sand control technique and equipment in China research and development project started late, but the sand making equipment technology in China has reached the international advanced level of equipment, sand making machine, favored by domestic and foreign customers, I believe that through our joint efforts, our country sand making equipment will have great transcendence. Artificial sand is put into use, there is a great help to alleviate the shortage of stone in the engineering construction, become the backbone of Engineering stone production.</p>

          <p>It is understood that, whether it is for the construction of large-scale infrastructure construction is small, an irreplaceable role, sand and gravel aggregate in engineering and is very important, because it is directly related to the quality of the quality of the whole project, therefore, the country give repeated orders and injunctions, strictly eliminate shoddy, shoddy aggregate materials into engineering construction. As we know, concrete mixing stations and stone factory is mainly to gather aggregate, especially the concrete mixing station construction of low threshold, high profit advantage is more like a raging fire to stir the industry development. According to statistics, in China, there is no lack of some raw materials mixing stations provide for oneself, they buy the crusher, sand making machine and other equipment for aggregate production, production through-train mode saves the cost of outsourcing to enterprise development, can be said that the mixing station sand has become a new field of the building materials industry. In order to promote the concrete mixing station scale, intelligent production, China's largest aggregate production line equipment manufacturers Zhengzhou Dingsheng according to the production characteristics of the concrete mixing station specially developed equipment system integration, the main broken sand and sand for mobile mobile impact roller, the two ways of sand preparation system covers an area of small, mobile and convenient, can bring their own power, and combination, convenient transportation, suitable for all kinds of working conditions. It is worth mentioning that, impact type sand system used in Germany imported sand making machine is the main equipment of double cavity type rotor structure, high production efficiency, machine flexibility, and patented, greatly reducing the incidence of blocking parts wear and debris in the process, can be described as sand making equipment currently the most economical, the most money.</p>
